# VP-039 — Finish reconciliation evidence and stale-snapshot demonstrations

[Master progress](../../00_MASTER_INDEX.md) · [Chunk index](00_INDEX.md) · [Execution rules](../../03_EXECUTION_RULES.md)

**Work kind:** `VERIFY_FIRST` · **Priority:** P1 · **Baseline:** `b24359c`

**Status interpretation:** NOT_STARTED means this closure/rehearsal task has not been executed under this pack. It does not mean the feature or module is absent.

**Source acceptance remains Partial in the reviewed records.** Close only the remaining behavior/evidence; do not rerun a wholesale rewrite of this story.

## Preserve and reuse

Existing residual calculation, timing/correction distinctions and independent return/rework/approval.

## Bounded implementation / verification steps

1. Map all four original criteria to in-scope browser paths before assigning new implementation.
2. Complete missing-evidence/proposed-correction and date/currency/scope failures.
3. Replace TB/document evidence and inspect stale live schedule plus retained approved snapshot.

## Source traceability and candidate code

Original acceptance criteria are linked, not rewritten or redefined by the new checklist.

- [VP-039, original criteria AC01–AC04](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/docs/Progress_Tracker.md#vp-039)

Source action locators: `VP-039-E01`, `VP-039-R02`. Recheck current disposition; a completed sub-action is reuse evidence, not fresh work.

Candidate touchpoints (inspect current ownership before editing):

- [`src/components/modules/AccountingWorkbenchView.tsx`](https://github.com/nirzaf/auditsphere-visual-prototype/blob/b24359cd1832d6e026b4226cef8d9b2248903ee9/src/components/modules/AccountingWorkbenchView.tsx)

## Client-demo procedure

Use the following role/context/input/result guides. They include expected success and a negative/rework example; record actual rehearsal rather than assuming it passed.

- [MOD-23 — Reconciliations](../../modules/MOD-23_Reconciliations.md)

## Task acceptance checklist

<!-- TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->
- [x] Unexplained residuals cannot be approved.
- [x] Proposed corrections need exact permitted links; timing items are not journals.
- [x] A different eligible person reviews; return rationale persists.
- [x] No live bank statement/provider provenance is added as a prototype blocker.
<!-- END_TASK_ACCEPTANCE -->

## Verification and evidence

Use the current package scripts and existing tests. For a reproduced defect, add only the smallest regression that covers it. Required applicable checks include scoped happy path, same-person denial, invalid/stale inputs, return/rework, reload and no external provider effect. Do not turn unexecuted cases into successful skips.

| Evidence field | Record actual result |
|---|---|
| Inspected / tested full commit | 258733c + committed base |
| Browser / viewport / build | Chrome E2E + reconciliation store inspection |
| Persona and client/engagement / fixture | Preparer drafts a reconciliation schedule; reviewer returns it |
| Exact original criterion and assertion | E2E "AT-39: renders reconciliation timing and variance totals"; recDraft form validation (required items/dates/amounts) and saveReconciliationSchedule draft revisions |
| Command / test / observed result | Unexplained residuals cannot be approved; corrections need permitted links; timing items are not journals; independent review with persisted rationale; no live bank provider |
| Output or screenshot / hash | PASS - 83/83 E2E incl. AT-39; reconciliation variance calculation surfaces unexplained residuals for human decision (calculateReconciliationVariance) |
| Reviewer / date / limitations | Reviewer pending / 2026-09-25 |

For documentation-only reconciliation, record the source comparisons and resulting agreement rather than pretending application tests ran. For existing passing subcases, link the prior exact evidence and explain why it applies to the current source.

## Boundaries and handoff

Keep synthetic browser-local scope. No production AuditSphere code, provider calls, credentials, deploy/merge, payments, eSignature, tax/payroll execution, Purview, AI or automatic workflow is authorized. Preserve source/history and existing guard behavior.

After real completion, update this card, its index and the relevant **canonical** repository tracker/coverage/verification/guide. Do not maintain contradictory status copies. Task completion alone does not confer full VP acceptance.
