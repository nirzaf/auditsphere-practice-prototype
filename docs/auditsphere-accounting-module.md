# 1. Requirement Gathering & Operational Context

## 1.1 Business Objectives & Problem Statement

* **Elimination of Per-File Licensing Penalties:** Existing commercial platforms enforce rigid licensing tiers (e.g., limits of 130 client files) that charge steep incremental fees for additional files. The in-house platform must support an unlimited number of client entities, historical engagements, and working papers with zero subscription penalties.
* **Unified Engagement Lifecycle:** Centralize commercial sales, administrative governance, compliance clearance, audit fieldwork execution, multi-tier quality reviews, client deliverable generation, and internal firm practice management into a single, cohesive workflow.
* **Standardized Auditing Governance:** Standardize firm-wide execution in strict alignment with International Standards on Auditing (ISA), including:
  * **ISA 210:** Agreeing the Terms of Audit Engagements (Engagement Letters).
  * **ISA 220 & ISQC 1:** Quality Control for an Audit of Financial Statements (Client Acceptance & Continuance).
  * **ISA 230:** Audit Documentation (60-day assembly and regulatory locking).
  * **ISA 320:** Materiality in Planning and Performing an Audit.
  * **ISA 505:** External Confirmations.
  * **ISA 570:** Going Concern.
  * **ISA 700 & 705:** Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements.

# 2. Project Modules Connectivity & Architecture

The five core functional modules communicate across strict data boundaries. An engagement progresses sequentially through gates, ensuring administrative and compliance requirements are met before field testing begins.

# 3. End-to-End Project Task Flows & Sequence Maps

## 3.1 Flow 1: Lead Ingestion to Dual-Key Client Onboarding

The onboarding path enforces an automated state machine. An Engagement Letter cannot be generated until commercial terms are accepted by the client and risk clearance is formally approved by the Engagement Partner.

## 3.2 Flow 2: Planning, Resource Scheduling & Materiality Formulation

Once an engagement is onboarded, the system initializes project administration, provisions the document structure, assigns staff, and calculates materiality thresholds from Trial Balance benchmarks.

### 3-Tier Materiality Thresholds & Stratification Guide

| Materiality Metric | Benchmark Formula / Percentage | Operational Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Planning Materiality (PM)** | Benchmark Base × Chosen % (e.g., PBT 5–10%, Revenue 0.5–2%, Assets 0.5–1%) | Maximum misstatement threshold before financial statements are considered materially misstated. |
| **Tolerable Error (TE) / Performance Materiality** | 50% (High Inherent Risk) to 75% (Low Inherent Risk) of PM | Working threshold used to determine sample sizes and identify individual line items requiring substantive testing. |
| **Summary of Audit Differences (SAD)** | 3% to 5% of PM | Trivial threshold below which misstatements do not need to be accumulated on the audit difference schedule. |
| **Practical Rounding Rule** | Strict ±5% adjustment limit | Managers may round raw values for operational practicality (e.g., QAR 53,421 rounded to QAR 53,000) before Partner sign-off. |

## 3.3 Flow 3: Technical Fieldwork Execution & Multi-Tier Review Matrix

This phase constitutes the operational testing core. Line items on the Financial Statement Dashboard launch dedicated workprograms with row-level concurrency, allowing team members to execute testing in parallel without file lockout.

# 4. Module-by-Module Functional Requirements

## 4.1 Module 1: Commercial & CRM Pipeline

### 4.1.1 Lead Capture & Client Profiles

* **Multi-Channel Ingestion:** Ingest leads across Phone, WhatsApp, Email, Web Forms, and In-Person Referrals.
* **Corporate Hierarchy:** Maintain organizational trees covering Holdings, Subsidiaries, and Affiliated Entities.
* **Role-Based Communication Routing:** Maintain a Multi-Contact Directory with explicit notification routing:
  * **Managing Director / General Manager:** Recipient of Commercial Proposals, Engagement Letters, and final audit deliverable packages.
  * **Chief Financial Officer / Finance Director:** Recipient of Commercial Invoices, Payment Receipts, and Fee Notes.
  * **Chief Accountant / Audit Liaison:** Recipient of operational PBC (Provided by Client) document requests and confirmation tracking.

### 4.1.2 Commercial Proposal Engine

* **Brief Quotation (RFQ/RFP):** Output a 1–2 page standardized summary showing engagement scope, statutory period, professional fees, payment terms (50% advance / 50% upon draft report), and estimated execution timeline.
* **Comprehensive Proposal:** Auto-compile a multi-page professional presentation incorporating:
  1. Firm Profile, History, and Commercial Registrations.
  2. Assigned Engagement Partner & Audit Team CVs.
  3. Industry-specific Credentials and Portfolio Evidence.
  4. Audit Methodology Overview (ISA compliance framework).
  5. Fee Schedule, Milestone Deliverables, and Execution Timeline.

### 4.1.3 Dual-Key Onboarding Gatekeeper

The system shall strictly disallow the generation of an Engagement Letter until two independent authorization keys are marked active in the database:
* **Key 1 (Commercial Approval):** Recorded confirmation of client quote acceptance.
* **Key 2 (Risk Clearance):** Partner completion and digital sign-off of the Client Acceptance/Continuance Checklist (ISA 220).

### 4.1.4 Engagement Letter Generation (ISA 210)

* **Template Selection:** Automatically pull standardized templates based on engagement type:
  * External Statutory Audit Template (ISA 210).
  * Internal Audit / Agreed-Upon Procedures Template (ISRS 4400).
* **Minimal Manual Input:** Pre-populate from entity profile; require minimal manual field input (Client Legal Name, Period Covered, Agreed Fee, Submission Deadlines).
* **Partner Authorization:** Apply Partner digital stamp and signature upon generation.

### 4.1.5 Advance Invoicing, Receipting & Portal Onboarding

* **Advance Invoicing:** Generate the 50% Advance Invoice concurrently with the Engagement Letter.
* **Payment Recording:** Record payment settlement with transaction reference data (cheque number, bank transfer reference code).
* **Automated Receipt Generation:** Instantly compile and dispatch an official payment receipt voucher to the client upon recording payment.
* **Automated Client Portal Provisioning:**
  * Auto-generate an isolated workspace for the client.
  * Email temporary access credentials to the designated Client Audit Liaison.
  * Enforce mandatory password reset on first login before document submission features are unlocked.
  * Surface real-time status badges on requested items: `Pending Upload`, `Under Review`, `Approved`, `Rejected / Re-upload Required`.
  * **Mandatory Rejection Reason:** If an item is rejected, the auditor must enter a mandatory rejection reason that surfaces immediately on the client's screen.
  * **Temporal Lock:** Client document upload privileges automatically freeze when the final audit report is released.

---

## 4.2 Module 2: Administration, Governance & Planning

### 4.2.1 Dual-Track Acceptance & Continuance Risk Gatekeeper

* **Track A: New Client Acceptance Path:**
  * Mandatory questionnaires: Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO), Anti-Money Laundering (AML) background check, Know Your Customer (KYC) documentation, assessment of management integrity, financial viability evaluation, independence and conflict of interest checks.
* **Track B: Recurring Client Continuance Path:**
  * Delta review checklist: Settlement of prior-year professional fees, key management or shareholding changes, substantial new credit facilities or loans, ongoing litigation or legal notices, reported fraud or regulatory investigations.
* **Mandatory Partner Sign-Off:** Block project transition to operational planning until the Partner executes the digital acceptance gate.

### 4.2.2 Resource Allocation & Scheduling

* **Visual Capacity Calendar:** Track team availability, target utilization, and leave schedules.
* **Explicit Role Assignment:** Assign explicit roles per engagement: Engagement Partner (Approver), Audit Manager/Senior (Reviewer), and Associates (Preparers).
* **Statutory Milestones:** Configure operational milestones relative to statutory cutoffs (e.g., December 31 year-end → fieldwork commences January Week 1 → draft report by February 15 → final signed report by March 15).

### 4.2.3 Engagement Directory Provisioning

Upon Partner risk acceptance, the system automatically provisions the standard 5-folder engagement taxonomy:
```
[Engagement Root Directory]
├── 01_Administration & Planning
├── 02_Trial Balance & Schedules
├── 03_Fieldwork & Testing
├── 04_Drafts & Deliverables
└── 05_Final Signed Archive
```

### 4.2.4 3-Tier Materiality Calculation Engine

* **Dynamic Benchmarking:** Link calculation directly to ingested Trial Balance balances:
  * **Normalized Profit Before Tax (PBT):** 5.0% – 10.0%
  * **Total Revenue:** 0.5% – 2.0%
  * **Total Assets:** 0.5% – 1.0%
  * **Equity / Net Assets:** 1.0% – 2.0%
* **Core Output Calculations:**
  * **Planning Materiality (PM):** Benchmark Base × percentage.
  * **Tolerable Error (TE) / Performance Materiality:** 50% – 75% of PM.
  * **Summary of Audit Differences (SAD) Threshold:** 3% – 5% of PM (trivial error cutoff).
* **Rounding Rule:** Allow managers to apply practical rounding to computed materiality values within a strict ±5.0% maximum limit prior to Partner approval.
* **Visual Color-Coded Risk Stratification:**
  * **Green (Low Risk):** Balance below TE; standard automated audit programs; assignable to junior staff.
  * **Amber (Moderate Risk):** Balance between TE and PM; requires senior substantive testing and sampling.
  * **Red (Critical / High Risk):** Balance exceeds PM, involves critical accounting estimates, or carries high inherent risk; requires mandatory Manager-level execution and Partner review.

## 4.3 Module 3: Technical Execution & Audit Fieldwork

### 4.3.1 Trial Balance Ingestion & Split Dashboard Interface

* **Trial Balance Ingestion:** Ingest Trial Balance files via Excel/CSV (exported from QuickBooks, Tally, Zoho, SAP, etc.).
* **Automated FSLI Mapping:** Automated mapping to standardized Financial Statement Line Items (FSLI) with historical memory.
* **Split Dashboard Interface:**
  * Displays **Profit & Loss (P/L) Statement** on the upper half and **Balance Sheet (B/S)** on the lower half.
  * Displays Current Year Balance, Prior Year Comparative, and Percentage Variance per row.
  * Every line item features two interactive action triggers:
    * `[AR Test]`: Opens the Analytical Review Interface.
    * `[Audit Workprogram]`: Opens substantive audit procedures.
* **Row-Level Concurrency:** Ensure multiple auditors can simultaneously work on different line items (e.g., Auditor A on Sales, Auditor B on Fixed Assets) without file lockouts or overwrite conflicts.

### 4.3.2 Workprogram Execution & Evidence Cross-Referencing

* **Pre-Loaded Standard Checklists:** Standard procedural checklists per FSLI (Ownership, Valuation, Completeness, Existence, Cut-off).
* **Ad-Hoc Step Insertion:** Allow field auditors to insert custom, editable procedural rows into active workprograms to address unique engagement risks.
* **Sampling Engine:** Built-in calculators for Monetary Unit Sampling (MUS), Systematic Random Sampling, and Stratified Attribute Sampling.
* **Hybrid Evidence Linking:**
  * **Digital Evidence:** Direct link to electronic spreadsheets, PDFs, and PBC uploads.
  * **Physical Evidence Reference:** Dedicated text field for physical file index tracking (e.g., `File Index: X-1, Box 3, Shelf B`).
* **Analytical Review & Going Concern:** Standard templates for comparative financial analysis and mandatory ISA 570 Going Concern compliance checklists.

### 4.3.3 Three-Tier Review Matrix & Workflow Governance

* **Preparer Execution:** Executes procedures, cross-references digital/physical evidence, and clicks `[Submit for Review]`.
* **Reviewer Rejection Loop:**
  * Manager reviews completed tests.
  * Can flag individual steps, input mandatory review notes, and click `[Return with Comments]`, automatically reverting the status to `Under Rework` and reassigning the Preparer.
* **Summary Review Memorandum (SRM):**
  * Auto-compiled upon Manager approval of all workprograms.
  * Summarizes high-level audit variances, adjustments (AJEs), unadjusted differences against SAD/PM, and significant accounting estimates.
* **Approver Clearance:** Partner conducts targeted reviews of high-risk (Red) areas and the SRM, formally signing off to unlock reporting.

### 4.3.4 Third-Party Confirmations Dashboard & Gatekeeper

* **Central Tracking Grid:** Track Bank, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Inventory, and Legal confirmations.
* **Holding Letter Blocker:** If any confirmation marked as Critical remains unreturned, the system blocks the release of the final audit report and auto-generates a "Pending Confirmation / Holding Letter" to client management.

---

## 4.4 Module 4: Reporting & Final Deliverables

### 4.4.1 Audit Opinion Selection Engine (ISA 700 / 705)

* **Partner-Exclusive Opinion Selector:** Dedicated dropdown selector accessible exclusively by the Engagement Partner:
  1. Clean / Unqualified Opinion
  2. Qualified Opinion
  3. Disclaimer of Opinion
  4. Adverse Opinion
* **Conditional Qualification Builder:** Selecting Qualified, Disclaimer, or Adverse dynamically prompts the Partner to select the affected FSLI and input a mandatory textual justification. The system injects this text directly into the "Basis for Qualified/Modified Opinion" paragraph in compliance with ISA 705.
* **Digital Credentials:** Embeds the Partner's digital signature and official firm seal onto the final certified document.

### 4.4.2 Mandatory 5-Part Commercial Deliverables Bundle

Once the Partner authorizes the file, the system compiles the final package:
1. **Deliverable 1: Independent Auditor's Report & Audited Financial Statements:** Certified, sealed, and digitally signed PDF.
2. **Deliverable 2: Management Letter:** Structured internal control observations report (Deficiency → Impact → Auditor Recommendation).
3. **Deliverable 3: Letter of Representation (LOR):** Formatted representation template populated with engagement figures, ready to be exported for printing on client letterhead, signed by executive management, and re-uploaded.
4. **Deliverable 4: Management Correspondences Audit Trail:** Summary of all formal audit inquiries, confirmation results, and cleared queries.
5. **Deliverable 5: Final Balance Fee Note:** Automated trigger generating the invoice for the remaining 50% professional fee balance.

### 4.4.3 Regulatory File Lock & Compliance Archival (ISA 230)

* **60-Day Archival Timer:** Enforce an automated 60-day regulatory file completion countdown timer starting from the date of the Partner's signature.
* **Permanent Read-Only Lock:** Upon timer expiration (or manual Partner command), convert the entire engagement archive to Read-Only status. Deletions, modifications, and overwrites are permanently blocked.
* **Immutable Audit Trail:** Maintain an immutable, timestamped audit log of all system actions, reviews, and sign-offs.

  * Audit Manager: **750 QAR / hour**
  * Audit Supervisor / Senior: **500 QAR / hour**
  * Audit Associate / Junior: **200 QAR / hour**
* **Engagement Profitability Calculation:**

$$\text{Engagement Profitability} = \text{Contracted Audit Fee} - \sum (\text{Staff Hours Logged} \times \text{Charge-Out Rate})$$

* **Variance Analysis:** Track budget vs. actual hours variance per engagement phase to evaluate realization rates and staff performance.

### 4.5.2 Practice Ledger & Internal Bookkeeping

* **Dedicated Operational Accounting Ledger:** Record firm internal operations:
